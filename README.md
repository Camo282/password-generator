# Password Generator Starter Code

I begain addressing the prompt to start the generator.  When the Generate Password button is selected, users will be prompted for a length for their password between 8 and 128.

They will then be asked if they would like to include the other criteria.

I then added an object and array, defining the acceptable letters, numbers and symbols to be used when generating a new password.

Updated <div></div>'s to be more specific, including main, section, footer within the HTML.  Saved to GitBash branch and pushed to develop, then merged.
